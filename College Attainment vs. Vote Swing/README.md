# The Correlation Between College Attainment in Presidential Vote Swings: An Analysis Using New England

**Model Description**: a linear model that estimates the correlation of vote swings between presidential elections with college attainment rates. The model uses data from all 67 counties in the 6 New England states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

**Relevant Term Definitions:**
  - *Vote Swing*: the difference in percentage point margin of victory or loss for a given political party between two similar elections
    - For example, if the Republican wins a certain state by 5 points (50% to 45%, as an example) in one election, but in the next election the Democrat wins by 2, that is a 7 point vote swing to the Democratic party between the two elections
  - *College Attainment*: the percentage of residents in a given county that have completed a full college education
